# üí´ About Me:
I‚Äôm a developer passionate about technology and innovation. My journey into programming began at the age of 18, driven by curiosity and a desire to learn. Since then, I‚Äôve specialized in web development, starting with the fundamentals of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and I‚Äôve never looked back.

Over time, I‚Äôve continuously sought to improve my skills, explore new technologies, and create solutions that have a positive impact on people. Today, I continue learning and sharing my knowledge through projects and collaborations.

After finishing high school, I began my undergraduate studies in Systems Analysis and Development at S√£o Paulo Tech School (SPTech), where I deepened my knowledge in application development, with a focus on React and Spring Boot. During my studies, I built a solid foundation in systems analysis and gained a comprehensive understanding of the processes that shape the world of technology.

My practical experience was further enriched when I joined the Rappi software development team as a front-end developer. This opportunity provided me with valuable insights into how the tech industry works in practice, enhancing my technical skills and strengthening my understanding of teamwork within agile environments.

I believe every day is a new chance to learn something new. I am driven by curiosity and a constant desire to expand my knowledge, exploring new technologies and challenges.

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on personal web development projects, exploring the use of React, Node.js, and RESTful APIs. I‚Äôm also building a sports data analytics application, combining my passion for technology and sports.<br>üëØ I‚Äôm looking for collaborations on projects involving front-end, UI/UX, and web development. I‚Äôm interested in working with creative and innovative teams to build scalable and impactful solutions.<br>ü§ù I‚Äôm always open to learning more about software architecture and best practices in application development. If you have tips or experiences to share, I‚Äôd be grateful!<br>üå± I‚Äôm currently diving deeper into TypeScript and Next.js to enhance my front-end development skills and build more robust and scalable applications.<br>üí¨ Feel free to ask me about React, JavaScript, front-end development, and how to integrate modern technologies with best practices in agile development.
